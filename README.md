# website-with-html5-features-and-very-little-to-no-css
Website is made with html5 features as they are way more easier to use than html4 and very basic css used for the header and footer
website is basic af, no explanation needed i think.
As you can see this website is linked to my other one which is html only(html4 specifically)
